<h1>Hello,</h1>
<p>
  Thank you for the opportunity for introducing myself. My name is Kim, and the following content is from an application I created with Meteor using MongoDB and JavaScript (JS). This app allows users to organize recipes based on health concerns, for example: recipes low in trans-fat would be beneficial for people with heart problems and would be organized under “heart concerns”. Creating this app allowed me to apply skills learned from the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). Technical skills include creating JS algorithms to query MongoDB for the correct recipes. This query needs to filter recipes based on health concerns, meal type, cost, serving size, and more; all determined by the user. Completing this ePortfolio also allowed me to enhance software design skills, shown through documents for this app. Previous documents contained technical requirements, whereas the current documents also contain user/system functionality requirements.  
</p>
<p>
  Designing and implementing this app shows my capability to learn new technical skills quickly. The Meteor platform, JS, and other languages such as HTML and CSS were learned for this app specifically. New resources were required and found, in order to correctly use these new skills. Using fundamentals from Object Oriented Programming and cybersecurity (such as sanitizing user input) as well, a functional app was created for my interests (food and health). I am a capable problem-solver and especially enjoy organizing information. 
</p>
<h3>Thank you!</h3>

  <h2>Software Design & Engineering</h2>
  <p>
    The artifact included are documents for my project that show software design and development. I created them because it allowed me to step back from my project and view it with object oriented programming and design, rather than technical programming and design. Overall, I learned that my project is really easy and simple. While I was working on these documents, it made me realize that getting lost in the technicalities of the program made it seem very difficult. The requirements part of the document breaks down the project without getting lost in technicalities. The functional and structural models allowed me to organize the project into objects so I could better organize the code, itself. I condensed my “client” folder containing thirteen “.html” files to ten, realizing that these components are so simple they should be in one file.  

I also learned that my “planning” at the beginning of this project was a different type of planning. I was planning very technical layout and app-flow issues to make the app work. This project would have been more organized had I planned for software design and development. Requirements, code, schema, and more would have been documented and better organized.

  <h2>Algorithms & Data Structures</h2>
  <p>
    The artifact included is documentation for a data structure required for my app. The data structure holds information for the health concern categories. Each category needs its own instance and holds information such as general, tips, good foods, bad foods, and sources. Each category has a list of foods that will benefit for that health concern. The foods need to be displayed with the good nutrients included. I selected this artifact because it shows how I handled data for my app. There are many ways to display this type of information and I tried to balance it so it is functional and user friendly. The system should hold relevant information like salmon has good amounts of Omega3s. I had to determine if I will display the exact content or in another way so users do not get overwhelmed and the system still has all the important information needed for possible feature expansions later. The artifact was created this week and is still in the process of improvement as I am researching more into foods and health concerns. For example, I decided that I need to included notes of “high saturated fat contents” and then also “high sugar content”.  

I am continuing to learn that I could have planned a lot better. It is problematic as I am developing something while also researching for the topic. I should have documented better as I developed, to help with the lack of planning. If I had documented the data structure earlier, I might have also thought out the extra notes such as adding “high saturated fats”. Since I thought of certain notes later, I need to double check foods inputted before the new requirements. I have also improved my project by updating the html code to reflect the new data structure.

  <h2>Databases</h2> 
  <p>
    The artifact included is my script for uploading files into MongoDB that was created during module five. It parses through a JSON file and then inserts it into Mongo as a document. I selected this artifact because other demonstrations of database usage in my app will reveal code that is specific for my project. The code might not make sense and doesn’t demonstrate extreme skill in databases. This script shows I am comfortable with Mongo, scripting, and Meteor (because I use Mongo through Meteor rather than directly on my device). I also used OWASP’s cheat sheet for securing file uploads (n.d.) and read through the documentation for my file upload feature. I checked my code to make sure files must be less than 10mb and png/jpg/jpeg type.  

I do have a better understanding of the file uploading process. I copied and pasted the code required for the file uploading feature without fully understanding the process and the package files. I should have documented the package files and the code I copied. If I documented the package name and version, I could make sure the documents I’m reading are correct. I didn’t comment the code well, besides “image upload stuff”, and should have commented more. It’s been a while since I included this feature and I don’t remember what I learned previously. Going back to this feature to enhance it, I had to relearn everything (including the package name).
