<h1>Hello,</h1>
<p>
  Thank you for the opportunity for introducing myself. My name is Kim, and the following content is from an application I created with Meteor using MongoDB and JavaScript (JS). This app allows users to organize recipes based on health concerns, for example: recipes low in trans-fat would be beneficial for people with heart problems and would be organized under “heart concerns”. Creating this app allowed me to apply skills learned from the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). Technical skills include creating JS algorithms to query MongoDB for the correct recipes. This query needs to filter recipes based on health concerns, meal type, cost, serving size, and more; all determined by the user. Completing this ePortfolio also allowed me to enhance software design skills, shown through documents for this app. Previous documents contained technical requirements, whereas the current documents also contain user/system functionality requirements.  
</p>

  Designing and implementing this app shows my capability to learn new technical skills quickly. The Meteor platform, JS, and other languages such as HTML and CSS were learned for this app specifically. New resources were required and found, in order to correctly use these new skills. Using fundamentals from Object Oriented Programming and cybersecurity (such as sanitizing user input) as well, a functional app was created for my interests (food and health). I am a capable problem-solver and especially enjoy organizing information.
